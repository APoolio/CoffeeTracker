# CoffeeTracker
Compare productivity to coffee cups

## Description
Working on an Android Application that will compare my productivity levels in regards to the amount of coffee I consume. Requires the user to routinely input the amount of coffee they have drank (8 oz., 10 oz., etc.) and then prompts the user with a notification to record how productive they have been over the last hour and an half. Coffee vs producitivty will be shown graphically. 

## Current State of the Application
